    <h2 id="sub-head">Early Life</h2>
    <hr id="line">
    <p id="para1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobias Vincent Maguire was born on June 27, 1975, in Santa Monica, California, to Wendy Brown and Vincent Maguire.[1][5][6] His parents (who are both of Scottish ancestry)[7] married shortly after his birth[1] but separated when he was two years old, and Maguire spent much of his childhood living with various family members.</p>
    <p id="para1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his childhood, Maguire entertained the idea of becoming a chef and wanted to enroll in a home economics class as a sixth grader. His mother offered him $100 to take a drama class instead, and he agreed.[9] The transient nature of his school years began to take a toll on Maguire emotionally, and after another relocation for his freshman year, he dropped out of high school and did not return. Instead, he pursued an acting career.[10] By 2000, he had obtained his General Educational Development credential, noting that during his school days, "I was not doing school; I was showing up, but... not really giving myself."</p>
